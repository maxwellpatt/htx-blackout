# A Geospatial Analysis of Houston's Blackout Sensitivity

## Purpose
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Houston Blackout Sensitivity Analysis" project. The purpose of this project is to conduct a thorough geospatial analysis of the February 2021 blackout in Houston. Utilizing several data sources including night light data from NASA, OpenStreetMap data, and socio-economic data from the American Community Survey, the analysis estimates the number of homes affected by the blackout and explores the socio-economic factors influencing community resilience during power outages.
